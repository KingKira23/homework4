the idea that i had behind this is to have all the questions at display none and as one goes through the the test the display would change to show the questions and hide the one before.

timer works when begin btn is pressed

I dont get how event listeners are supposed to work i was only able to get the timer to work and in messing with the event lisiners for the questions i broke the timer and i dont know why its going past 0 now
